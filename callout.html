        <h3>Stories of Collision</h3>
        <p>What happens when objects collide? There is the moment before, the impact and the aftermath, in which a series of energetic exchanges occur as forces ricochet, merge, consume, alter, fracture and shatter one another. 
        As the moon affects the tide, collisions govern the way our world functions, from emergence through to collapse. Collisions occur in the physical realm, the political, the spiritual and beyond, through time, space, earth, bodies, culture, technology, ideals.
        From the scope of a single-celled organism to vast galaxies, violent conflicts to a delicate kiss – the impact of one narrative, one character, one entity upon another as they cross paths can be at once elemental and monumental, like the devastating hurricane created from the flutter of a butterfly’s tiny, proverbial wings.</p>
