    <p id = "about-text"> Hello, this is Griit. We are the amalgamation of a photography and an architecture
        student who love experimenting with different ways of gifting weight and mass to
        digital spaces.
        Dancing between printed and digital matter, our practice-based research
        methodologies are born out of a deep love and reverence for obsolescent
        technologies and frivolous formats, coupled with an innate connection to digital
        spaces. We work closely with our clients to sensitively cultivate and celebrate the
        idiosyncrasies that make up their unique grit, so that their grittiness may permeate
        through whatever it is they wish to gift to the world. We have a comprehensive set of
        skills to match our sweeping, far-reaching interests; from fine art, design and
        drafting, to branding, copywriting and web development. Ultimately however, Griit
        can be summed up as a digital creative agency run by two creative problem solvers
        committed to the exploration and construction of new ideas, physical objects and
        digital spaces of enduring warmth.
        Our <br> <br> Our names are Maud Freeman and Thandi Lane and if you would like to collaborate with us then please do get in touch.
        We can be contacted via email at ‚Üô <br> <br> <a href="mailto:griit.studio@gmail.com">griit.studio@gmail.com </a> </p>
